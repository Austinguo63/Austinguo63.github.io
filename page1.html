            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is BookChain, who is initial target customer, and what is the benefit to customer of using this product/service? </h2>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This product is a blockchain-based decentralized book platform where users can write and earn from their books or read for free as readers.
                <br>What makes this platform unique is that based on Blockchain, we can establish a mechanism that issues a Blockchain token every time users interact with the platform. Fans can purchase a piece
                 of shares (NFT or non-fungible token) of their favorite books; for example, a book has 100 NFTs for sale. Every time a reader reads a chapter from any NFT, we issue $0.5 worth of tokens, and 50% of 
                 this value will go back to the writer, 25% to NFT owners, 10% to all readers, and 5% to the special host that hosts this NFT online (a rough model that will be adjusted as we go). This Token will be
                  able to be exchanged back to $ on most Crypto Exchanges, just like Bitcoin. Meaning for readers, just read whatever you like for free, no hidden charges at all. <br><br>
                 <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Reader: </h3> 
                 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also engage in a writer's career by purchasing their NFTs. You now have part of ownership, and because of its digital footprint, it can be read by many other people. Therefore, as the owner, you 
                benefit. The tokens you earn can be used to purchase more book NFTs, join book signing events, exchange back to $, and more.<br><br></p>
                <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Writers: </h3> 
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that not everyone can get support from major publishers, especially for early-career writers who may write as a hobby or as a side job and cannot spare more effort. With Bookchin, 
                you do not need to go through the process of finding an editor, passing an editor's review, and all that. Now BookChain gives power back to the entire reader community; the more people read your book, 
                the more money you will make. Whether a book is good or not, reader decides.</p>
